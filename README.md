# VAX-DisplayProject-2.0
The program code for a Raspberry Pi 3.0 with a 720p Touchscreen that will show the ongoing and upcoming events for a lounge using Google Calendar API. This lounge is the VAX Workshop and Movie Theatre space on Engineering House at RIT in Rochester, NY. This program is open source and I encourage others to view and make edits.
